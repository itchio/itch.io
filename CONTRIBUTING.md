Thank you for submitting an issue. This issue tracker is for managing issues
with the itch.io website, such as bug reports and feature requests. You can
also check our community support and feedback communities here:
<https://itch.io/board/10016/itchio>. Our team actively monitors these pages.

**The issue tracker is not for support with games and projects on itch.io.
itch.io does not develop the games on the marketplace. Please refer to the
game's page to find contact information for individual developers.** If you
cannot find their contact information, you can contact our support team at
<https://itch.io/support> and we can forward your message to them.

**The issue tracker is not for account-specific or payment customer support.**
Our support team needs to keep track of support requests in a centralized place
to work most effectively, and we are unable to verify who you are on a
third-party platform like GitHub. To receive account support, you must contact
us through our support page: <https://itch.io/support>.

We cannot provide account or payment support on GitHub. If you still need to
ask about a support request in an issue, you must include your Ticket ID (a
number included in your support request receipt email) so we can look it up in
our system. Do not share private account information on our GitHub (emails, tax
info, etc.), as all issues are publicly available.

If the issue you are reporting is specific to a particular page, please include
that URL with your issue so we can reproduce it.

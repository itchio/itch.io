Following another account on itch.io is a simple way to stay up to date with
what they're doing. You can follow as many accounts as you like. To get the
most out of itch.io, we recommend following everyone you find interesting.

Here are some benefits of following someone:

* Your [Feed][my_feed] will be populated with their activity, including new games published, games rated, things added to collections, and devlog & blog posts written.
* You'll receive an email notification when they publish a new game (unless you've disabled notifications in your account settings).
* The person you followed will receive a notification, which can make them feel appreciated.

In conclusion, following someone is a simple way to support them and keep track
of their latest activity. Following more people also helps you create a great
source of the latest happenings in the indie game dev world.

### Who should I follow?

That's for you to decide! We generally recommend following anyone with whom
you've had positive interactions. No need to be picky; if you end up not liking
what they do, you can always unfollow them later.

The itch.io site suggests people for you to follow based on your activity as
well. You can find your suggestions on your homepage and on [your
feed][my_feed].

### Where can I see who I follow?

If you go to [your feed][my_feed], you can click the **followers** and
**following** sections to see who your followers are and who you're following.

## Why should I try to get more followers?

If you're a game developer or creator on itch.io, gaining followers can be a
highly effective strategy to build your audience. Not only does it enhance the
credibility of your account on itch.io, but it also provides you with a larger
group of people to whom you can market your work.

* Your followers will receive an email whenever you release new games or projects.
* Any new devlog posts or other account activity will appear in your followers' feeds.
* If you put one of your projects on sale, followers who do not yet own it will receive an email notification about the sale.

Maintaining a robust follower base ensures that when you launch a new project
on itch.io, you are maximizing the visibility of your work. This can play a
crucial role in elevating your project in our listings and potentially being
featured on our homepage.

### What's the best way to get more followers?

At itch.io, we love helping developers get more followers. We have many
reminders for anyone who positively interacts with your project, including
whenever someone purchases, downloads, or rates your project. However, this may
not be enough, so we also recommend that creators manually promote their
itch.io pages. Simply telling someone to follow you outright isn't the most
effective approach, so we suggest including an incentive as well. Here's an
example:

> If you want to see my progress, you can follow my itch.io page here: YOUR URL

If you have a completed project, you can say:

> Did you like my game XXX? You can get updates by following my itch.io page: YOUR URL

You can suggest a follow by linking to your profile page. Posting on social
media, your blog, and other websites is a good way to increase your audience.
If you have a completed work, you can also suggest someone gives you a follow
directly within your game. For HTML games, you can consider suggesting a follow
after someone has played your game for a bit.

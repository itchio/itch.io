## Why was itch.io made?

itch.io was made to give game developers a marketplace where they get to
control how their content is sold. Check out this blog post: [Introducing
itch.io](http://leafo.net/posts/introducing_itchio.html).

## I'm a game developer / musician / comic artist / writer!

Then we'd love to welcome you on **itch.io**, where you can upload both paid and
free content, design a page for it, keep track of views, downloads and
purchases, and run your own sales and bundles however you want.

## Why buy on itch.io?

  * **itch.io** allows sellers to set their own revenue share: we call that
  [open revenue sharing][ors] - that makes it one of the best place to support
  your favorite creators.
  * Most **itch.io** releases come with DRM-free builds along with extra keys,
  when the game is also available on Steam.
  * Simply, there's a lot of content on **itch.io** you will find nowhere else!

## How do I find the cool stuff?

Here are a few tips to discover cool new content on itch.io:

* Keep an eye on the [front page](/) - the projects featured there are staff
  picks and meet a certain level of quality and originality.
* Use the [randomizer](/randomizer) to find random games according to a few
  filters you can adjust. Great for finding gems that you might have otherwise
  missed.
* Follow the people that interest you. Don't have anyone in mind? Check out
  the [global creator feed](/feed) or simply keep an eye on the [new
  releases](/games/newest).
* If you have an account, browse through [my
  recommendations](/my-recommendations), which are tailored to the content
  you've played or downloaded. Alternatively, click the *View related games*
  button on any project page to find more of the same!

## Can I organize the content I see/play/own on itch.io?

Sure! If you have an **itch.io** account, you can add any page to a
collection, which you can then choose to show on your profile.

To add a page to a collection, simply click the 'Add to collection'
button on the page itself. You can even write some words about it,
which will be displayed next to the page's thumbnail when viewing
the collection.

The *Edit collection* button lets you control the visibility of
the collection, whether it's shown on your profile or not, pick
the layout (grid or list), and add a description. Additionally, you
can add contributors to a collection to curate in groups!

> favorite games of 2014](http://itch.io/c/3570/favorites-of-2014), with longer
> blurbs.

## How can I keep up with my favorite creators?

With an **itch.io** account, you can follow any creator, and it'll appear in
[your feed](/my-feed). There you'll find things like new projects, updates, new
uploads, ratings, etc.

> If you don't know who to follow, take a look at the [Featured games
> feed](/featured-games-feed) -- it's guaranteed to have some interesting
> stuff!

## I've lost my purchase confirmation e-mail! How do I get the link again?

You can recover all purchases you've made with a given e-mail by filling
the *Recover purchases* form on our [support page][support].

Alternatively, you can access all your purchases by logging into
your itch.io account and navigating to [My purchases](/my-purchases)
or [My collections](/my-collections).

Registering for **itch.io** with an e-mail already used for purchase will
automatically link all your previous purchases with your new account as soon as
you verify the email address on the account.

## I found an offensive / broken / copyright-infringing page. What do I do?

Every **itch.io** page has a *Report* link down at the bottom. It opens a
form that sends a message directly to the itch.io admin team, which will
take appropriate action.


## How can I delete my account?

To delete your itch.io account, follow the steps below:

1. Log into your itch.io account.
2. Navigate to [Delete Account][delete-account] in your Account Settings.
3. Read the information carefully to understand the consequences of deleting your account. This action is irreversible.

retained for legal and tax purposes. In some cases you may be requried to

removed support for Bitcoin. At this time, we have no plans to add
cryptocurrency support.

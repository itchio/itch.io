  title: "Community rules"
}

Thanks for reviewing the itch.io community rules. These rules apply to all
community pages on itch.io, such as message boards and project comments. The
moderators of individual communities may set their own additional rules. Those
who abuse the rules may have their community privileges removed or their
account suspended.

As always, any activity on itch.io is subject to the [Terms of Service][terms].
Upon participating in any community on itch.io, you must also abide by the
following rules.

## Disclaimer

itch.io is not responsible for any user-generated content posted to the site,
and is not responsible for the behavior of any member, including [community
moderators](#community_moderators). We try our best to foster a safe and
constructive community, so don't hesitate to [report any content you are not
comfortable with](#reporting_bad_behavior).

## The rules

1. **No flaming, trolling, spamming, or other disruptive behavior**  
Anything that interrupts or stops the flow of normal conversation, such as
numerous lines of one word of text, excessive caps, excessive links, etc., may
result in your post being removed. Repeated offenses may result in account
suspension.

2. **Do not create posts about sensitive topics that may instigate argument**  
While we certainly respect free speech, we ask for your consideration of others
in the channel and in our community. Avoid posting material that promotes
polarizing views about religion, race, gender, politics, or any other groups.

3. **Harassment of any individual, regardless of if they are a member or not, will not be tolerated**  
Messages containing inflammatory remarks, threats, or other abusive behavior
toward another individual will result in account suspension. Posting personally
identifying information about others is not allowed. This includes, but is not
limited to: real names, email addresses, photos, phone numbers, and addresses.

4. **Do not attempt to impersonate any user, or pass yourself off as a moderator/administrator.**  
While we encourage users to assist one another, please do not present yourself
as having "official" information or otherwise mislead others.

5. **Do not post unsolicited or bulk advertising/promotion**  
Comments and communities are not for advertisement or self-promotion unless
explicitly specified. If you feel you have something highly relevant and
specific, then feel free to share it, but if you're posting only for the sake of
advertising, then your posts will be removed, and your posting abilities may be
disabled. This also includes signatures or copy-pasted text appended to
comments. Focus on creating quality comments and replies, and people will be
more likely to click back to your profile to learn more about what you've
created.

6. **Do not violate the [Terms of Service][terms]**

## Community Moderators

A community moderator is anyone *not employed* by itch.io who has the ability
to edit, delete, or moderate the posts of other users. Anyone who creates a
community is a community moderator, and they may select additional moderators.

All community moderators are subject to the same rules as any other member on
itch.io. If you see a community moderator abusing their privileges, please
contact us.

Community moderators are responsible for maintaining a healthy community and
may take any action they see fit within the realm of the rules. If you have any
disputes about any decision made by a community moderator, please politely seek
them out in private to raise your concerns before contacting an administrator.

## Reporting bad behavior

If you see something that you're not comfortable with, please don't hesitate to
click the report button below the post. A moderator will review your report as
soon as possible. If it's something that needs to be addressed faster, please
[contact us via our support email][support].

If you're a moderator of a community with offending content, you can also
delete the content and ban the user if necessary from the report dialog. If
you're still having trouble, please [get in touch with a site admin via our
support email][support].

### 8. Transactions and Fees

> **Summary** Publishers can set their own prices for their games (or even make

> (that you set) and may be required to withhold an amount of the sales for
> tax, VAT and other charges.

Publishers may set the prices, at their own discretion, for their content and
products to be sold through the Service (each sale, a “Transaction”). The
Company shall be entitled to a share of the revenue Publishers receive from
Transactions which shall be calculated on the gross revenue from the
Transactions, not including any Transactions for which Publisher or Company

and taxes through its payment providers, and will pay to Publisher the proceeds
net of the applicable Revenue Share, payment provider fees, and applicable

authority. Use of IP proxies or other methods to disguise your place of
residence, whether to circumvent geographic restrictions on content, to
purchase at a price not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose,
is a violation of this Agreement.

### 9. Refunds

> **Summary** You may be eligible for a refund if the product does not work or
> does not represent what was advertised. Please [contact support][support] for
> help.

Users may request, and Company may process, refund requests if the purchased
content cannot run, some other issue prevents access to the content, or the
product does not accurately represent what was advertised. For technical
issues, Company will direct users to the Publisher to first try to resolve such
issues. To request a refund, please [contact support][support] with your
purchase information. For content selling third party external keys (e.g. Steam
keys), Company may require the Publisher to confirm cancellation of the key
before a refund can be processed due to the Company’s inability to disable
access. Some Publishers utilizing older payment methods are responsible for
handling refunds themselves. If you are uncertain about refund eligibility,
please [contact support][support].

### 10. Unclaimed Earnings In Publisher Accounts

> **Summary** If you don't withdraw earnings from your account older than a
> year, we may charge a maintenance fee proportional to any unclaimed money
> older than a year left in your account. Itch.io is not a bank, so you need to
> claim your earnings in a timely manner. If you need Itch.io to withhold
> unclaimed payments longer than 12 months [contact support][support].

Publisher accounts receiving Payouts from the Company are subject to a
maintenance fee for unclaimed transactions. Payouts from the Company are
issued when the Company is the Merchant of Record.

Accrued revenue from transactions initiated over twelve (12) months ago that
has not been claimed for withdrawal may be subject to a maintenance fee.
Company reserves the right to debit your Publisher account balance per month:

* Ten percent (10%) of the original revenue earned per purchase older than twelve (12) months

until your balance reaches zero or you initiate a withdrawal for the remainder
of the balance. Publisher accounts may request to delay this fee by [contacting
support][support] and expressing their intent to claim at a determined time in
the future.

> In simple English, this means that after 1 year, if you haven't initiated a
> payout for the earnings of a purchase, 10% of it will be debited from your
> account per month. After 10 months you will no longer be able to claim any of
> that purchase.

The maintenance charge will not cause your account balance to become negative
and will not cause you to owe money to the Company.

Publisher accounts with purchases initiated before the publish date of this
clause (May 24, 2018), have a six month grace period (until November 24, 2018)
where the maintenance fee will not be applied.
